## Abilities and security features

Every Infosphere node has HP, INF abilities and additional parameters related to its security procedures.
Reducing a node's HP to zero means taking control, reducing INF to zero means destroying data.
The following table describes the abilities and protection mechanisms for each security class.

- The `HP` and `INF` specify the die to be used to roll the value of the ability (along with the modifier)
- The `ICE` determines the attack die for the Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics and determines the chance that a given ICE will be black (we roll the Fate Dice, x/6 means that the results from 1 to x give a positive answer).
- The `Activation Threshold` informs about the maximum value that activates additional protection program in a given round.

| Security class  |  HP   |  INF  | Activation Threshold | ICE attack die  |
| --------------- | :---: | :---: | :------------------: | :-------------: |
| Public          | d4+1  |  d4   |          1           |       d4        |
| Private         | d4+1  |  d4   |          2           |       d4        |
| Private secured | d6+2  |  d6   |          3           |       d6        |
| Government      | d8+3  |  d8   |          5           | d8, 1/6: Black  |
| Corporation     | d10+4 |  d10  |          7           | d10, 2/6: Black |
| Military        | d12+5 |  d12  |          9           | d12, 3/6: Black |
| AI              | d20+6 |  d20  |          12          | d20, 4/6: Black |

### Additional protection software

Each node may have additional protective software. Its activation is not necessarily inevitable and depends on the result of the roll during the ICE attack.
The procedure does not require any additional dice roll - the value is taken from the ICE attack, if the roll result is less than or equal to the activation threshold, in the same round the program is launched and its type is taken from the protective software table, also based on the value of attack.

| d4 - d20 | Protective Software                                     |
| :------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|    1     | HP +1 (*)                                               |
|    2     | HP +2 (*)                                               |
|    3     | HP +3 (*)                                               |
|    4     | Armor +1                                                |
|    5     | Armor +2                                                |
|    6     | Armor +3                                                |
|    7     | Dispersion: the hacker's next attack is impaired        |
|    8     | Critical damage: additional d4 damage                   |
|    9     | Critical damage: hacker's attack impaired for d4 rounds |
|    10    | Critical damage: hacker disconnected for d4 rounds      |
|    11    | Firewall: inability to hack in the next round           |
|    12    | Double attack (roll two dice, choose the higher result) |

(*) If the hacker controlled the node,at the time of the HP increase, he loses that control until he reduces the node's HP to zero again.

> Example of protective software activation
>
> Ian attacks the corporate node, which means the ICE has d10 attack die.
> Additionally, d6 roll gives the result of 2 which means that the attacked ICE is "black" (in case of failure in the critical damage test, Ian will receive additional PSY damage)
> At the time of the attack, ICE rolls 5. It means that:
>
> - Ian will receive **5 points of damage** (at first he subtracts it from his HP and then from his INF).
> - An additional protection program has been **activated** (activation threshold 7)
> - The effect of the protection program is **+2 armor** in this round (**item 5** in the table), the damage dealt to the node by Ian will be reduced by 2 (the attack of the hacker and the node are resolved simultaneously)

# Additional algorithms

Several additional mechanisms to expand Infosphere gameplay.

## Clashes between hackers

The basic version of the game assumes that hackers can attack nodes in the Infosphere and be attacked by Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics.
But what happens if several hackers from opposite sides meet?
The neuroprocessor gives the hacker a much greater ability to operate the Infosphere but at the same time exposes him to direct attacks from the network.

It is possible to attack the hacker's mind in a similar way to the Infosphere node.
Such an action has to be performed by another hacker; no software can do it. There are rumors that some AI also happened to attack the human mind.

The clash follows the same rules as for nodes. The opponents **attack with neuroprocessors** and the damage is dealt first in the opponent's HP and then INF. Attacks take place simultaneously.
Reducing the hacker's OCHR to zero or below means that the other side can **take control of the stimuli** received by the defeated party for **as many rounds as their current INF**.

Taking control only applies to the hacker's sensorium (sight, hearing, smell), it does not include motorics, i.e. you cannot control the opponent's body. But you can instead completely control his perception.

## Supporting

If two or more hackers wish to coordinate their actions when attacking a node, their actions are accounted for similarly to multiple attackers in the combat rules.
Roll **all** damage dice and keep one **chosen** result.
The difference with physical combat (where the highest score is chosen) is that hackers can modify the effect of an attack with programs. When resolving the attack, **only those programs** that belong to the **owner of the selected roll** can be activated.

## Passengers

Any hacker can connect any number of ordinary access devices to his neuroprocessor. This way, outsiders who do not have a neuroprocessor can have constant contact with him and even observe his online activities. However, none of the passengers can take any action in the Infosphere; their participation is limited only to passive observation or communication with the hacker.
