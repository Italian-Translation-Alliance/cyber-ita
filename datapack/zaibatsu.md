# Zaibatsu

Corporations (referred as “zaibatsu”) are an integral part of the cyberpunk universe. They wield enormous influence and resources. They are able to control politics, the media and determine the living conditions of most people in the world.
However, they are not all-powerful and their ranks still include ordinary people with their ambitions, fears and needs.
The Zaibatsu also have enemies – sometimes government institutions, sometimes the military and sometimes market rivals.

The generator presented below is meant to be an inspiration for filling your world with sinister market forces.

[Online version](https://oswida.github.io/cyber/app/dist/#/gen?lang=en&mode=Corporation)

## Procedure

Roll or select:

- The first part of the name (d20+d20)
- Second part of the name (d20+d20)
- One or more industry sectors in which the corporation operates (pay attention to the second part of the name and complete with the matching industry if necessary) (d20+d20)
- At least one rumour about the corporation being generated (may be true or not) (d20+d20)
- One or more resources and one or more objectives of the corporation (d20)
- An employee profile if you wish to specify one (d20)

## Roll d20+d20

A roll marked as d20+d20 means that we roll two d20 dice, but the first value is used to determine the column (group) and the second value is used to determine the position in the group.
This roll replaces the roll with a dice of more faces (e.g. d100) and at the same time allows you to draw from a pool that is a multiple of twenty: 40, 60, 80 or 120.

## First part of the name (d20 + d20)

The first roll selects the column, the second selects the position in the column.

## Industry sector (d20 + d20)

The first roll selects the group, the second selects the position in the group.
Next to each industry, there are examples of products that may appear in zaibatsu's offerings.

### Industry dependent on the name

The names of the corporations in most cases have an English origins. This is an intentional effect related to classic games and mainstream literature.
If you decide to use the generator, please note that the second part of the name often also reflects the industry in which the company operates ("software" probably suggests software development and "chemicals" the chemical industry).
It is worth taking these relationships into account when creating the ”zaibatsu”.

### Multiple sectors for one company

When creating corporations, you can choose more than one industry for the company.
Sometimes selected industries may seem too far apart from each other such as "agriculture" and "financial services". However, there is no contradiction in this. As powerful organisations focused on maximum profit and efficient market operation, corporations often expand their activities.
This gives them additional income and protects them from sudden market fluctuations within a single industry.

### Objectives (d20)

Examples of how to achieve each objective are given next to each entry, and may consist of more than one activity. Corporation objectives can be used as potential tasks for players or elements of the world that players will have to deal with (for example, by counteracting the achievement of a given objective).

1. Damage the competition (destruction of equipment, site or killing, transfer of employees)
2. Discredit the competition publicly (scandal in the media or political arena)
3. Take control of a selected public domain (transport, municipal financing, municipal services)
4. Maximise sales profits (winning a contract, free product advertising)
5. Steal competitor data (product documentation, personal records)
6. Discredit a well-known politician (to gain political influence or as an act of a revenge)
7. Force or persuade a well-known public figure to sign a contract

18. Discreetly contain an uncontrollable disaster within the corporation (virus outbreak among employees, internal computer network failure)
19. Recover stolen data (technical product documentation, personal records)
20. Discreetly get rid of an inconvenient member of your own management (public scandal, kidnapping, fabricated evidence of a crime)

### A favour for a favour

A simple concept of cooperation between players and corporations If the players' actions during the session have contributed to any goal of a corporation, the referee marks a credibility point (dot, symbol or whatever) next to that corporation. Each credibility point can be used once to access one of the corporation's resources. Assistance in the realisation of an objective can be overt (execution of one or more tasks) or coincidental (the actions of unwitting players coincide with the goals of the zaibatsu).

## Employee Profile (d20)

During the course of the game, the protagonists are bound to come into contact with zaibatsu employees. And they may even want to run a game in which they are able to navigate the corporate reality, at least for a while. 
In order to give each corporation a certain characteristic, you can define a profile of its employees.
Representatives of a given zaibatsu are not all the same, but belong to a community in which certain behavioural patterns are accepted and even popularised by corporate management.

The proposals presented below are forms of behaviour developed by corporate communities - thus going beyond mere employee loyalty to the corporation.

1. **Personal honour and sense of duty**: I'm making my own decisions and take responsibility for them; one of those decisions was to work for the corporation; I am not a slave and the corporation is not my master.
2. **The common good (of the corporation) is the highest value**: the people who employ me know better and it is my job to carry out their plans as carefully as possible.
3. **What you can't see does not exist and everyone has many faces**: I firmly deny these heinous slanders, the person on the recording is probably a fake clone or the recording itself has been tampered with.
4. **A good servant must have good wages**: should I go into this hole? no way, I don't earn that much here.
5. **One big family**: next week we are celebrating the birthday of the head of the department, my daughter has prepared a poem for the occasion.
6. **It's just a job, nothing personal**: I do what I do, everyone has a job to do so why the fuss?
7. **Only the best reach the top**: I'm only 20 points short of entering the promotion zone. At this rate, I'll be a department manager by the end of the year.
8. **What you gain with your own hands is yours**: so what if Anna was better than me? She missed out, made a mistake and I seized the opportunity. Life.
9. **The less you can be seen, the safer**: It's better not to send this letter, someone might see, tell someone and we'll be in trouble. Who needs this?
10. **Success is achieved with patience**: Your grandfather started as a simple factory worker, I am already working as a foreman. If you keep this up, maybe you will make it to the head of the department.
11. **The day of retribution will come**: yes, now we have to do what we are told, somehow we have to survive, but one day we will rise up and then blood will be spilled.
12. **Everyone can have their profit**: the company earns and I earn too, and if the company earns more I can have more too, thus simple.
13. **We consciously and responsibly create a better world**: these apocalyptic visions are exaggerated, corporations are a natural step in evolution. We understand this and we participate in the process of building the future. If you have a better alternative, we invite you to discuss it.
14. **A place for everyone, everyone in their place**: everyone wants to feel needed and not everyone has the same opportunities, thanks to this work there are no disregarded or unappreciated people among us.
15. **If one doesn't have what one like...**: one likes what one has. Don't complain, it could be worse.
16. **United by a common enemy**: it may not be perfect with us but with them, it's a mess. We need to eradicate this abomination.
17. **Common vision**: you can laugh, you can doubt and you can ooze the poison of betrayal. When the great day comes you will see that we were on the right side. And everyone will thank us.
18. **We are better than others**: our specialists are the best, our methods the most effective. Being a member of this community is an honour and an ennoblement. We do not socialise with the motley crowd.
19. **Clearly established rules**: the rules are known and everyone follows them, what's so strange about that? Would you prefer complete chaos and unfair games?
20. **Let's talk about it**: talking, talking and more talking. Everyone can be talked to and everyone can be convinced ... or at least develop some kind of consensus. The worst thing is when people whisper in corners.
