# Cyber RPG

**Cyber** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Cyber is a role-playing game about the exploration of a dark world of the near future, dominated by megacorporations and technology. Players take on the role of inhabitants of a giant metropolis - a crowded, noisy city full of greed, hypocrisy and shady dealings.
Characters can climb the career ladder of *zaibatsu*, operate on the edge of the law as freelancers for hire, or lead a settled (albeit not unchallenged) life as a member of one of thousands of factions - from religious sects to the city's emergency services.

It is based on the [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/).
